# Draft: New Polarization Section

**[This replaces/modifies lines 83-101 of post.md]**

So people boycott Coke, boycott Bud Light—who cares? It's just consumer choices, right? The thing about this balance theory is that it scales. And when you apply it to social graphs—to actual communities of real people—it can lead to quite dramatic outcomes.

## How Polarization Tears Communities Apart

Think about a friend group. Six people who've known each other for years. They have dinners together, go on trips, celebrate birthdays. Everyone gets along. It's harmonious.

But here's the problem: three of them love Trump, and three of them hate him. Not just mild preference—we're talking fixed, non-negotiable positions. The kind dictated by media consumption, family background, tribal identity. These aren't opinions that change.

![Initial State: Harmonious Community](polarization_demo/01_initial_state.png)

Alice loves Trump. Dave hates Trump. But Alice and Dave have been friends since college. They're in a group chat. They went to each other's weddings.

This is the unbalanced triangle: Alice has a positive relationship with Trump (+1). Dave has a negative relationship with Trump (−1). Alice and Dave have a positive relationship with each other (+1). When you multiply these signs together—(+1)(+1)(−1)—you get −1. Unbalanced.

What does this mean in human terms? It means the friendship is unsustainable. Not because Alice and Dave don't care about each other. But because this fundamental disagreement about a polarizing figure creates a tension that pervades everything. They can't talk about politics. One of them is always biting their tongue. Every news cycle is a minefield. The friendship that once felt easy now requires constant emotional labor.

If you've lived through the Trump era, you know this feeling. You've either been Alice or Dave. Maybe you've lost friends over it. Maybe you're the one who pulled away. Maybe you just stopped returning calls, stopped showing up, let the relationship quietly dissolve because it became too hard to maintain. This isn't a thought experiment—this is the lived experience of millions of people.

And it's not just one friendship. In this friend group of six, every person who loves Trump has this tension with every person who hates Trump. That's nine unbalanced triangles spread across the network. The entire community is a web of unsustainable relationships.

So what happens? The only way to resolve these unbalanced triangles is for friendships to break. But here's the twist: it doesn't happen cleanly. It doesn't happen all at once.

![Energy Dynamics: The Path to Polarization](polarization_demo/energy_dynamics.png)

When we measure the "energy" of this network—counting how many unbalanced triangles exist—the initial state starts at 9. That's nine points of tension, nine unsustainable relationships. You might think: okay, if Alice breaks with Dave, that should reduce the tension, right?

Wrong. It gets worse first.

When the first friendship breaks, the energy actually goes up—from 9 to 13. More people get upset. More relationships become strained. It feels like the community is falling apart, and in a sense, it is. The second break makes it worse still: energy climbs to 15.

This is the hill-climbing paradox. To get to a stable state, the community must first pass through a period of increased chaos. Things must get worse before they can get better. Friendships that could have survived must break to resolve the broader pattern. It's not enough for Alice and Dave to drift apart—the entire structure of the social network has to reorganize.

And eventually, it does. Friendships continue to break—Alice with Dave, Bob with Emma, Carol with Frank. The group chat goes quiet. People stop getting invited to things. The community splits.

![Final State: Two-Camp Structure](polarization_demo/02_final_state.png)

In the end, you have two camps. Camp One: Alice, Bob, and Carol—the Trump supporters. They're still friends with each other. Camp Two: Dave, Emma, and Frank—the Trump opponents. They're still friends with each other. But between the camps? Nothing but negative edges. Not just absence of friendship—active hostility. People who used to care about each other now can't stand each other.

And the energy? Zero. Fully balanced. Every triangle resolves: within each camp, everyone agrees (+)(+)(+) = +1. Across camps, it's us against them (+)(−)(−) = +1. Alice loves Trump, hates Dave, Dave hates Trump. Balanced.

The community is "stable" now. The temperature drops. Everyone is comfortable again—as long as they stay within their camp. But this isn't the harmony they started with. This is a cold war. Two mutually exclusive groups, totally antagonistic to each other. And that can be just as dangerous.

## The Conquest of Self and Other

But Girard points out that this seemingly innocent phenomenon sits on a continuum. And on the more extreme ends of that same bell curve, we find the exact same mechanism leading to disastrous consequences. Most notably: anorexia. The desire to be thin, fit, attractive, high-class—the very same desire that makes someone order the Brussels sprouts—can escalate to the point where you overcome not just your appetite for sweets, but all appetite. All your animal needs are sacrificed purely in pursuit of the holy grail of thinness, even to the point of extreme ill health and, in some cases, death.

This is where Girard's analysis becomes chilling. The anorexic has overcome the most basic human need of all—the need to survive—out of mimetic desire. Girard compares the anorexic to Napoleon, to Alexander the Great: "In the competition for absolute thinness, the true anorexic is Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, and Napoleon all rolled into one." This person has maniacally conquered their own being. Every obstacle of appetite, every instinct for survival, left in the dust. They have sacrificed themselves to the conquering of their own body, their own flesh.

The anorexic declares war on herself. The model becomes the god of thinness—the unattainable ideal. And the enemy? Food. Fat. Sustenance. The very things the body needs to survive. She will deprive herself of what she needs, override every biological signal screaming for nourishment, all in service of this mimetic pursuit.

Now here's the parallel: Once these political relationships become established—once Trump becomes your model or your anti-model, once the other camp becomes the enemy—the same mechanism takes hold. You will deprive yourself of things you need. That Coke you actually enjoyed. Those friendships that mattered to you. The sense of community you once had. You'll give it all up to maintain tribal purity, to stay aligned with your camp, to not betray the cause.

And just as the anorexic conquers her body through extreme deprivation, the political zealot conquers the enemy tribe. The Republican conquers the Democrat. The Democrat conquers the Republican. It's the same mimetic mechanism—the same capacity to override self-preservation, to sacrifice what you need, to declare total war in pursuit of a model and against an enemy.

This is why it matters. This is why we should pay attention to these seemingly silly cultural phenomena—the Coke boycotts, the Bud Light controversies, the sparkling water instead of soda. Because it's the same mechanism. It's a difference of degree, not of kind.

The same dynamic that makes you choose Brussels sprouts over mac and cheese can make you choose your political tribe over your friendships. And if it escalates far enough, it's that same mechanism which will make you overcome your animal need to survive, your instinct for self-preservation, in order to be a good member of your tribe—whether that's left or right.

That's the danger. How exactly this mechanism escalates to violence, how it has worked in past societies, and how it will work in ours—that's a story for another day. We have more theory to work through, and we have more dynamics to understand.

But friends, newcomers, if you've made it this far, thank you for reading my first post of a publication I'm calling **Political Atheism**, a title which, to those who know Girard's theory, is hopefully clear. To those who do not, I will explain at some point. I hope you found this useful. I thank you for taking the time to read. I'm hoping to find the time to do posts like these frequently enough, so if you aren't already, throw your email in. I think that given this crazy state of the world, these are important ideas to be exploring. And I welcome any feedback, any thoughts, any comments. If you know me, feel free to reach out personally. I'd love to pick up the phone and talk through this stuff if you find this of interest.

-Best, Ajax's Sheep.
