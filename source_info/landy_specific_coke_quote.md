What Bakhtin understood—and Girard apparently did not—is that most situations present
us not with one but with multiple possible models. I can join the left-wing party, like my brother
David, or the right-wing party, like my brother Aron. I can drink Coke, as Penélope Cruz appears
to be urging, or Pepsi, following the promptings of Cindy Crawford. (I can even stick to water,
following my doctor’s more sensible advice.) I can take up arms like Malcolm X or resist nonviolently like Martin Luther King. I can be good like Abel or bad like Cain, gracious like Saint Francis or vicious like Sade. For Girardian hermeneuts, finding an apparent model is like shooting
fish in a barrel: there is always someone they can point to as the ostensible origin of my actions.
But what they can’t do is to explain the mysterious lack of force field surrounding everyone else.
Why, when I joined the left-wing party (ostensibly borrowing brother David’s example), was I
not infected by my other brother’s desire? Why, when I chose the glass of water, was I immune to
the combined charms of Mss. Crawford and Cruz? It’s true that we tend not to make choices in
splendid isolation—I didn’t invent the left-wing party, or nonviolent resistance, or sugary
drinks—but we do make the choices. Other people cannot make them for us, precisely because
there are too many other people, with too many different opinions.

Superficially, of course, advertising seems like a highly propitious field for Girardians. Many
commercials, like the ones above, feature prestigious individuals (film stars, for example) associated with products (soft drinks, for example); shouldn’t we say that if I buy the soft drink, it is
only because I am borrowing the imagined desire of the star? That may well, at times, be true.29
But the odd thing is that advertising does not always work (any more than my best friend Lanier’s
recommendations always find me receptive). “New Coke” and “Crystal Pepsi,” for example,
were infamous failures, in spite of their respective multi-million-dollar campaigns. Part of the
reason is that for a product to succeed, it’s not enough for consumers to sample it once: they
have to be tempted to come back for more. (A massively important source of desire, one might
say, is liking.) And the reason people keep coming back for more is not that they keep seeing

commercials; it is that they enjoy the product. You could saturate the airwaves with glamorizing
visions of Ann Coulter, but you’re never going to get me to prefer her over Zooey Deschanel

29 Of course, not all advertising works this way: in many cases the implication of a commercial is not that if we
consume X we will become like Y, but rather that if we consume X we will have Z. (Certain infamous beer
commercials, with their implicit promise of sex, are a case in point.)

Perhaps nowhere is this phenomenon—the resistance to contagion—more apparent than
in the high chair at dinnertime. “Nothing is more mimetic,” declares Girard, “than the desire of a
child.”30 One wonders, has he ever met a child?31 Has he ever tried to feed one a brussels sprout?
“Yum yum,” we say, absurdly hoping that our desire for healthy food will carry over mimetically.
“Blech,” says the child, unceremoniously spitting it out. You can’t get a child to want to eat brussels sprouts, because this kind of desire depends on liking, and children just don’t like brussels
sprouts. They do not get all their desires from parents (even in such a wonderfully closed environment, with so little outside stimulus). They can see their parents eagerly eating healthy food
till the cows come home, but they will stand right by their decision to yell for marshmallows.
(Not to mention their decision to yell for more. Where did little Suzie get the desire to hear the
same story ninety-six times in a row? Surely not from the grownup she’s tormenting with it.)
