So I'm wondering about this idea of there are like innate tastes and proclivities that people have later on in this article. He talks about how children, no matter how much you try, will always hate Brussels sprouts. Like they just taste bad. So you can never get them to like them.  

So I guess my, I'm curious, kind of, let's get down to the fundamental question of this. Like, do people really desire certain things? Are there some things that are just inherently pleasing to them, like the taste of some food, maybe like the sound of some music, how things look to them? Like, is it aesthetically pleasing? The idea is that there are certain things that are just innately more pleasurable than others.  

And then the Girardian critique of that is that, well, all that is just imitative, I think. But I don't know, maybe I'm wrong though. That could be an oversimplification of Girard's position. I'm wondering if Girard addressed this ever. If you can find any positions from him that address this point, especially at the fundamental level of something so simplistic as Brussels sprouts or, you know, Coke tastes good so people drink it. The commercial obviously has an effect, but like, it just tastes good. So there's a certain, like, the product just has to be good, to be pleasurable, to be satisfying. So I wonder how that factors into Girard's theory, or is this something that breaks the theory? Maybe give both perspectives. 

Context:
Superficially, of course, advertising seems like a highly propitious field for Girardians. Many commercials, like the ones above, feature prestigious individuals (film stars, for example) associated with products (soft drinks, for example); shouldn’t we say that if I buy the soft drink, it is only because I am borrowing the imagined desire of the star? That may well, at times, be true.29 But the odd thing is that advertising does not always work (any more than my best friend Lanier’s recommendations always find me receptive). “New Coke” and “Crystal Pepsi,” for example, were infamous failures, in spite of their respective multi-million-dollar campaigns. Part of the reason is that for a product to succeed, it’s not enough for consumers to sample it once: they have to be tempted to come back for more. (A massively important source of desire, one might say, is liking.) And the reason people keep coming back for more is not that they keep seeing commercials; it is that they enjoy the product. You could saturate the airwaves with glamorizing visions of Ann Coulter, but you’re never going to get me to prefer her over Zooey Deschanel.

Short answer: both things are true. Human beings do have some baked-in hedonic biases (sweet > bitter; fatty/umami = yum; intense bitterness = yuck) and real genetic differences in how we taste. But once you move beyond basic need and raw sensation, a huge amount of what we desire—what we keep choosing, what spreads through groups, what becomes “cool”—is learned, modeled, and mimetic.

What the biology says (the floor)
Sweet is innately liked, bitter innately avoided (on average). This shows up very early in development; kids are unusually bitter-averse. 
PMC

Genes matter. Variants of the bitter-taste receptor TAS2R38 help explain why some people (esp. children) find Brussels sprouts intensely nasty while others don’t.

Preferences can be trained. Repeated exposure and pairing a bitter veg with liked flavors (e.g., cream cheese) reliably boosts kids’ acceptance—even for Brussels sprouts.

Culture shapes “aesthetic” senses. The Tsimane’ of the Amazon show no preference for consonant over dissonant chords, a strong hint that a lot of musical “niceness” is learned.

Products themselves changed. Modern Brussels sprouts are literally less bitter than the 80s/90s versions due to breeding that lowered specific glucosinolates. Preparation (roasting → Maillard browning) also tilts flavor toward sweet/nutty.

What Girard actually says
Girard draws a sharp line between need/appetite and desire. If you’re alone in the Sahara and thirsty, you don’t need a model to want water. That’s need. Most of what preoccupies us in society, though, is mimetic desire—wanting things because models/rivals want them. 
The Book Haven

He applies this even to eating: in an essay on eating disorders, he argues that mimetic pressures (the “slenderness imperative”) can overpower biological appetite—evidence that social desire can dominate need. 
University of Innsbruck
+1

So no, Girard doesn’t deny hunger or basic liking. He says needs exist, but desire—the part that generates rivalry, prestige seeking, status competition—is socially mediated.

How to reconcile them (a layered model)
Sensory floor (biology): innate biases + genes set a baseline for what’s easy to like (e.g., sugar/caffeine/carbonation make Coke pleasant).

Learning/exposure: repeated tasting, pairing, and familiarity (“mere exposure”) push items up or down. 
PMC
+1

Mimetic layer: models, peers, prestige, scarcity, and identity make some things desirable and contagious.

Girard’s point operates mainly on layer 3; he grants layers 1–2. The theory “breaks” only if you insist that all preferences are mimetic. He doesn’t: he explicitly carves out needs/appetites.

Coke, ads, and “the product has to be good”
Liking vs wanting: Neuroscience splits reward into “liking” (hedonic impact) and “wanting” (incentive salience). Ads, status cues, and social proof amp up wanting; repeat purchase lives or dies on liking.

Why New Coke flopped: Sip tests favored sweeter formulas, but brand identity and “sensation transference” (packaging/meaning bleeding into taste) overwhelmed that edge in the real world. In short: mimetic/meaning layers can veto small hedonic gains. 
Wikipedia

Does a Brussels-sprouts (or Coke-tastes-good) case refute Girard?
No. The kid who gags on sprouts because TAS2R38 makes them ultra-bitter is a biology story; the teen who later insists roasted sprouts with pancetta are “chef-core” is a mimetic story layered atop changed product and repeated exposure. Girard would say: needs and raw hedonic reactions exist; but most of the interesting human drama—the rankings, fads, rivalries, status—comes from mimetic desire. 
The Book Haven

Bottom lines
Yes, some things are innately more pleasant on average. Biology and genes set a floor/ceiling. 
PMC

But beyond need, desire is heavily social. Whether people keep choosing something, signal with it, or fight over it is mostly mimetic. 
The Book Haven

Advertising rides layers 2–3. It can juice wanting and spread behavior, but if liking isn’t there, habit doesn’t stick (cf. New Coke).

If you want to test this in your own life: blind-taste more, track when a wanting spike follows exposure to a model/peer, and see what still compels you when nobody’s watching. That’s your layer-1/2 signal; the rest is contagion.

You said:
Okay, so I think you addressed the Brussels sprout point very well in distinguishing the difference there, but I'm still a bit confused on the Coke aspect of it, of like liking versus wanting. I guess here would be my critique of it, like, and it actually lines up perfectly with the whole anorexia bit where, okay, you want Coke because you saw someone else drink it, or you saw some ad with some like 70s nostalgia, but then when you drink it, you either like it or you don't. Now you could equally not want Coke because you view it as unhealthy. Unhealthy is maybe rooted in biology empirically, but it's still an abstraction of what you think is unhealthy or not, as evidenced by things that are considered healthy and not change all the time. You view drinking Coke as kind of trashy, as sort of low class, bad for your health. You've heard bad things about, you know, corn syrup and like whatever else is in it. And more than that, you want to appear like someone who is high class and cares about their health, et cetera. And so you drink something like sparkling water, right, which is zero calorie. It tastes fine, but it's definitely not as good as Coke. But in that case, the liking just gets totally dwarfed by the mimetic nature of this. I think another aspect is that in this essay, the critic focuses mostly on models you can actually see, like real people, a model in an advertisement, a celebrity, et cetera. 

When the example I just gave was like a kind of abstract ideal, the model can be something that is completely imagined and a sort of conglomeration of many different things, shaped by what you hear and what you read, what you see, who you talk to, who your friends are, but you can't pick out exactly who it is. And it's not one person, but it's just your conception of like, well, you know, a healthy person drinks sparkling water. Who is this healthy person? It's not one person in particular. It's just like the ideal model on this given topic. And for any given choice we make, we kind of create that ideal who we're modeling. Does this align with Girard's theory? Am I on the right track here or am I misappropriating it? Is this interpretation on the right line or am I drifting too far from what Girard originally stated? 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 22s
You’re not drifting—you’re basically dead-center Girard.

Here’s the clean way to slice it:

1) Appetite vs. Desire (Girard’s cut)
Appetite/liking = biological hedonic response (sweet, caffeine fizz → “mmm”).

Desire/wanting = social/identity-driven pull toward an object because it is tied to a model.

Girard never denies appetite. He says most interesting human choosing is governed by mimetic desire layered on top of appetite. That’s why anorexia (or asceticism) can beat hunger: the model (the ideal of thinness, holiness, “discipline”) outweighs the body’s liking. Your Coke vs. sparkling water example is the same structure.

2) “Liking gets dwarfed by mimetic pulls”—does Girard allow that?
Yes. In his vocabulary, this is metaphysical desire: you don’t just want the drink; you want the being you associate with the model (healthy, self-controlled, high-status). When that identity-reward is strong enough, it stomps the taste delta. That’s exactly why people keep austere diets, wear uncomfortable fashion, or buy under-hedonic but “correct” products. Girard would say: the object is a vehicle for the relation to the model.

3) “My model isn’t a person; it’s an ideal composite.”
Still Girardian. He distinguishes:

External mediation: distant, untouchable models (saints, celebrities, “the aristocrat”).

Internal mediation: near/peer models—often diffuse (the crowd, “people like me,” the imagined audience).
Your “healthy person” is a composite mediator you’ve internalized from friends, feeds, doctors, culture. It doesn’t have to be one face. The crowd can be a model; so can a class ideal. What matters is that your desire is triangulated: you ↔ mediator ↔ drink.

4) Why ads sometimes fail but stigmas bite
Ads can spark wanting (attach models), but if the identity fit conflicts (e.g., “Coke = trashy/unhealthy”), the mimetic penalty trumps hedonic liking.

Conversely, when an object carries positive mimetic charge (Topo Chico, matcha, kombucha in certain circles), mild taste costs get paid gladly; the identity dividend covers the bill.

5) A simple decision frame (why you pick sparkling water)
You choose A over B when:

Mimetic value(A) + Hedonic liking(A) − Moral/health cost(A) − Friction(A)
is greater than the same sum for B.

For you:

Coke: big hedonic, negative mimetic (signals “low-class/unhealthy”), non-trivial moral/health cost.

Sparkling water: small hedonic, positive mimetic (signals “healthy/disciplined”), low moral/health cost.
Net wins for sparkling water even if it “tastes worse.” That’s Girard in action.

6) Where people get Girard wrong
He doesn’t say everything is imitation. He says desire (not need) is mimetic. You can enjoy Coke alone in a cabin; that’s appetite. But what gets branded, moralized, status-coded, and spread (or shunned) is desire.

He doesn’t require a visible influencer. Anonymous norms and imagined audiences are valid mediators.

Contra strawman: Girard doesn’t deny that “the product has to be good” to sustain habit; he’d say mimetic forces decide which goods get trialed, moralized, and socially rewarded, often overpowering small differences in raw liking.

7) Quick self-tests (to feel the split in your own behavior)
Blind/private test: Do you pick Coke over seltzer when no one will ever know? If yes, that’s hedonic.

Audience flip: Do you reverse the choice in public or among “health” peers? That delta is mimetic.

Context swap: Same taste, different group (gym vs. gaming night). Do your choices track the group more than your tongue? Mimetic signal again.

Bottom line
Your “abstract ideal model” idea is exactly Girard’s internal mediation with a composite mediator. And your claim that mimetic identity can swamp taste is textbook Girard: metaphysical desire regularly outruns appetite. Biology sets the floor; mimesis sets the choreography.

You said:
And then what do you think about this? This is probably the most interesting part, which is now imagine like the celebrity of it in like a political. So like Trump likes Coke. He drinks a Diet Coke every day. If you genuinely hate Trump, and Trump is known as a person who likes Diet Coke, it makes it very difficult for you to like Diet Coke despite Trump. And if you really hated Trump, you would stop liking Diet Coke because you hate Trump so much. This is like, uh, so it's an unbalanced triangle of you hating Trump minus Trump liking Coke plus. And then the question is, what do you do if you like Diet Coke? Like, then the only option is for Diet Coke to stop liking Trump, right? So that would be the Coke company coming out and denouncing Trump and saying, "Don't use our product anymore," which they aren't going to do. 

So instead, you—but that has happened in other cases. There have been other examples where a commercial entity has denounced a political entity in an attempt to save their brand, protecting themselves from this mimetic contagion that I'm talking about.

Also, it could be the opposite. If you're a Trump supporter and you're not a big fan of Coke, but you see Trump liking Coke—that's the one everybody knows—and you start liking Coke. But it can also work in the reverse, like the Trump one I gave. I'm curious if that lines up with Girard's theory and also like balance theory of the like plus plus minus versus plus minus minus.

Short version: yep—what you just described is textbook Girard + classic balance theory. Your “me (−) Trump (+) Diet Coke” triangle is the Heider P–O–X triad: a negative tie to the person (Trump) and a positive tie between that person and the object (Diet Coke) exerts pressure to make your tie to the object negative—unless you change one of the other edges. That’s exactly the prediction of structural balance (Heider; Cartwright–Harary). 
Simply Psychology
+1

How the triangle resolves (not just “Coke must denounce Trump”)
Balance theory gives you multiple escape hatches; brands and consumers use all of them in the wild:

Flip your tie to the object (you → Diet Coke): you stop buying it (boycott) or switch to a close substitute to preserve taste while fixing identity (e.g., another zero-calorie cola). That’s the standard boycott response. 
Chicago Journals

Alter the object’s tie to the model (Diet Coke → Trump): the company distances, clarifies neutrality, or loudly aligns with the other side. We’ve seen many brands take political stances to protect themselves from contagion—e.g., Coca-Cola publicly opposing Georgia’s 2021 voting law, Keurig pulling ads from Hannity, MLB moving an event; these moves are about edge-rewiring to keep consumer triangles balanced. 
TIME

Vox

Recode the tie as neutral: “Trump drinks it; that has nothing to do with my choice.” Brands often try this—avoid explicit politics, segment messaging, or issue bland “we don’t do politics” statements—so the Trump↔Coke edge becomes irrelevant to you. (Same network fix: remove the +/− sign by making the edge negligible.) 
Wikipedia

Narrow the person-tie (you → Trump) just on this dimension: “I can loathe Trump but not let him contaminate beverages.” That’s a cognitive way to damp the mediator’s power (compartmentalization). The math of balance allows this if you can keep the edges weak enough. 
arXiv

Real-world proof that identity beats taste (often)
When politics tags an object, consumption shifts hard—even if the liquid didn’t change:

Bud Light 2023: a short social post triggered a year of depressed sales; HBR estimates sales/purchase incidence down ~32% in Q4’23—identity effects dominated flavor.

Where Girard plugs in
Your “I like sparkling water because the healthy ideal drinks it” is internal mediation by a composite model (the audience/peer-set you’ve internalized). Girard’s framework explicitly allows diffuse mediators; desire is triangulated through a model even when that model is an imagined type. 
Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy

Your “I now dislike Diet Coke because Trump likes it” is negative mimesis—you’re still letting the mediator structure your desire, just in opposition. Girard calls these rivalrous fixations scandals (skándalon): the rival becomes an obstacle-model that attracts and repels, guiding choices even when you think you’re “resisting.” 
Girardian Lectionary

So, yes: if you hate Trump and he’s glued to Diet Coke (and he is—famously reported at “up to 12 a day”), Girard predicts a strong pull to differentiate from the object or to force the brand to differentiate from the model. That’s your intuition, and it tracks both Girard and balance theory. 
The Washington Post

Why “the product must be good” still matters
Girard isn’t denying taste; he’s saying taste won’t save you once identity floods the channel. Political cues routinely swamp hedonic liking (Bud Light), but when the mimetic storm passes, repeat purchase still depends on liking. Identity can move the crowd; taste keeps them. The empirical literature on political consumerism shows both boycott and buycott dynamics—identity turns products into team flags. 
Harvard Business Review

TL;DR for your triangle
You (−) Trump, Trump (+) Diet Coke → pressure to make You (−) Diet Coke.

To escape, either you change (switch products, compartmentalize), the brand changes (distance/realign), or you nullify the mediator on this domain. All three are common in the field; we have clean examples of each.

Right. And number four, I think, is a hard area to live in because then you're living in your own world. So, like, let's say you're a liberal, you go out to dinner with other liberals, and you order a Diet Coke. Then everybody kind of looks at each other, gives a weird look, and someone decides to say something like, "Hey, isn't that like Trump's drink?" And then you feel awkward. You feel like, you know, different in a bad way. And you feel like, because of your choice of drink, you're being associated with Trump. So maybe next time you won't order the Diet Coke. And the reason that people say that is because they're so in the media cycle. That's all they think about. Like, they're so pent up with the idea of Trump's Diet Coke that they don't even think about Diet Coke as tasting good or whatever. It's like totally absent from their mind. 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6s
Yep—that’s the squeeze point: you’re not tasting; you’re performing. And once you’re performing, hedonic liking is a weak signal compared to audience pressure.

Here’s what’s going on under the hood, no fluff:

What you’re describing (in plain terms)
Audience-weighted utility beats taste. Your “order” is a public act. The payoff isn’t just flavor; it’s flavor minus the expected social penalty. If the table is very online and primed with the “Trump–Diet Coke” meme, the penalty term is big. So you defect from your taste next round.

Norm enforcement equilibrium. One person raises an eyebrow, another cracks the line—boom, the table coordinates on a stigma. Nobody has to love the rule; they just enforce it to avoid being the odd one out.

Preference falsification. You quietly like Diet Coke but publicly suppress it. The more this happens, the more everyone overestimates how much others really hate Diet Coke, and the norm hardens.

Internal mediation, composite model. The “audience in your head” (health-conscious, anti-Trump, high-status) is now sitting at the table with you. Girard would say your desire is triangulated through that model; the object is a vehicle of identity, not just taste.

Why “option 4” (compartmentalize) is hard
It asks you to eat a reputational cost every time you act. That’s sustainable only if:

the audience is weak (strangers, low-stakes), or

your identity payoff for resisting is stronger (you like being the contrarian), or

the norm salience drops (people stop caring).

Otherwise you’ll drift toward the group’s code. That’s not cowardice; it’s rational once you add the audience term to the utility function.

Practical playbook (if you actually want to keep ordering the thing)
Pick one—don’t mix them:

Context-switch, not mind-hack. Enjoy Diet Coke in contexts where the audience penalty ≈ 0 (alone, with apolitical friends, at home). Keep sparkling water in performative settings. Hedonic at home, mimetic in public. Clean separation.

Preemptive reframing. If you must order it, lane-switch the meaning fast:
“I’m on a zero-cal kick; caffeine without sugar is my vice.”
You’re overwriting “Trump” with “fitness/discipline.” It won’t flip zealots, but it shrinks the penalty.

Close substitute, same payoff. Coke Zero, Mexican Coke on cheat day, or a boutique cola. You keep the taste lane, lose the stigma tag. In balance-theory terms: rewire the object edge.

Own the bit. “Yeah, I like it; sue me.” This only works if your self-concept includes mild contrarianism. If it doesn’t, you’ll hate the aftertaste (not of the soda—of the social friction).

Engineer ambiguity. Order “a cola” when possible; pour into a glass; skip the brand call. Lower the visibility; lower the sanction.

Brand side (why companies flail here)
They face the same triangle you mapped. To avoid contagion, they either:

dilute the political edge (go quiet, broaden cues),

counter-signal to a different audience (risking a counter-boycott), or

decouple with many sub-brands and micro-tribal cues so each group can drink “their” version without tripping alarms.

Girard + balance theory verdict
You’re spot on:

This is internal mediation by a composite model (the imagined liberal audience).

The triad is unbalanced, and social pressure tries to flip your edge to restore balance.

If you don’t change the object or the mediator, you’ll likely change your tie (stop ordering) because it’s the cheapest edit in the graph.

Blunt truth: if the room is primed and status-conscious, identity eats taste for dinner. Either change rooms, change the read of the act, or change the act.
