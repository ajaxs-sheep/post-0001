Coke or sparkling water?

An examination of why we desire what we desire.

[Insert an image of Trump drinking Coke here.]

Why do children not like Brussels sprouts? Because they taste bad, right? And no matter how much coaxing you do, you can't get the child to try the Brussels sprout. Now, a simplistic reading of René Girard and his ideas on mimesis might make one think that his solution would be to have the parent sit and eat Brussels sprouts and say, "Mm, aren't these Brussels sprouts good?" And then magically the child will eat the Brussels sprout, but as most people know, it doesn't happen like that, at least not immediately.  Now, Joshua Landy uses this as an example to show how Girard's theory of mimetic desire, namely the idea that all desire is mimetic—that is, all desire is based not on one's assessment of the intrinsic value of something, but on them basing their desire on the desire of somebody else. He says that this proves that this idea of mimesis is wrong. Similarly, he discusses the example of Coca-Cola. People point to advertisements, Coke advertisements, as examples of how mimesis occurs in society, how if you put someone attractive, a celebrity, drinking a Coke on TV, it will make people want to drink Coke more. Landy's critique is that people just want to drink Coke, that Coke tastes good, and that is why people drink it. 


Now the thing is René Girard discussed this point exactly on multiple occasions, but I'll use a quote for simplicity from a more casual interview with an equally casual example from an interview he did in 2018, where the interviewer pushes him, asking, "How far do you want to go in saying that desire is fundamentally mimetic?" (quote from Girard interview) He gives the example of the difference between being alone in the Sahara Desert. And obviously, in such a scenario, you need water, right? It's an appetite we all have. Similarly, we have certain things that we are averse to. For instance, especially children are averse to bitter foods, which may have been an adaptation to avoid poisonous berries and other things, Opposingly, you have Coke where sweet sugar corresponds with calories, and calories with survival. And in both cases, it shows that we have certain chemical and biological developments that have occurred to make it so. We have certain intrinsic needs and appetites that are well-documented and undeniable, and Girard doesn't deny them—the most fundamental is the appetite for self-preservation. 

Where Girard's theory intervenes is that it's not that these things don't exist, these appetites and needs don't exist, but that they are oftentimes secondary to our desire for things that aren't needs but are wants, dictated more by what others think of us, or what we see others do, what we think others might think of us, and sometimes most importantly, what we will think of ourselves. These things drive more of our desires than oftentimes we care to admit.

Let's return to the Coke example. I personally don't drink Coke. Most people I know don't drink Coke. They don't drink soda. Why? Soda tastes good, so shouldn't they drink it? You might say, oh, well, it's obvious—they don't because soda is unhealthy. And there may be empirical truths that show that. But we don't know for a fact if it's healthy or unhealthy. It's only our best guess. And certainly, most of the decisions people make aren't a rational approximation of "this is good" and "this is bad." They may convince themselves that that's how they view the world, but oftentimes it's not. And even so, why does someone want to be healthy? Is it out of, again, that instinct of self-preservation, of wanting to maximize their longevity? Is this the lens through which people view their every move? Maybe for some of these longevity people, that's true, but even then that can't be the root cause of all action. 

Now, in the case of the Coke, the reason why people don't drink it, or the people of a certain status and class don't drink it, is that they view it as unhealthy, as low class, as bad for you, indulgent. And they view themselves, or they want to be the version of themselves that is high class, disciplined, healthy, fit, hot, desired, etc. So their model is not really the celebrity in the advertisement. Perhaps that reinforces the notion if the person in the advertisement is that sort of person. But there's no anti-Coke advertisement. Now, this might be a reason why the same sort of person doesn't drink Coke but does drink sparkling water. Sparkling water is zero calorie. It's fizzy. It's overpriced. It signals that you have disposable income enough to be drinking something more than water, but with the same calories and health benefits as water, even if the sparkling water might have artificial flavors, microplastics, or other things that could also be bad for you that we might find out in a decade are bad for us. Now it seems "healthy." Another classic example is the Brussels sprout appetizer at nice restaurants, which you see Brussels sprouts and you think, oh, that must be healthy. I'm going to be good and order the Brussels sprouts. And then they're served to you with bacon bits and oil, and there's no green left, only char. And what you've actually ordered is something that is not any more healthy than a side of fries, And the beautiful thing about this dish is it satisfies two desires. It both tastes good, which satisfies your childish appetite for something tasty, but also it makes you think, satisfies your mimetic desire to be a healthy person.  And this is the same sort of person who has a salad for lunch or a bowl from Chipotle to cut the carbs of the, you know, the burrito with basically all the same stuff in it, who walks into the office with a bag with a nice label on it. Again, you cannot chalk that up to, well, they need to eat something for lunch. Why don't they pack a sandwich? Why don't they make a salad at home?  It's because that product says something about them. But more importantly, they are basing their decisions on the imagined person they want to be, who eats this way, who goes to the gym this way, who looks a certain way, talks a certain way, eats a certain way. How did they form this conception of this imagined person? Did they have one singular model? Was there one ad, one relation? No. It's an amalgamation of things. It's what they read, what they watch, who they interact with, who they went to school with, who they grew up with, who their parents are. There's a complex web of interaction that results in something like this, and it's so complex it includes also what they are not, who they view themselves as against or different from the classes of people, the sorts of people who would drink a Coke or go to Burger King or have a beer, shoot guns, smoke a cigar, smoke a cigarette, drive a truck. Now making this out to be black and white, red and blue. It's not. There are layers to it. There are different factions within it. There are finance bros who, despite their upbringing in the more Sweetgreen, sparkling water-drinking crowd, have a longing for shotguns, cigars, hunting dogs, and traditional values, and view those groups as models, and have a sort of fantasy of themselves being that sort of person despite being locked in a suffocating urban environment. 

Now this becomes most extreme when people forget whatever natural appetites they had for this product or that. This tastes good, this tastes bad when they neglect that entirely for the mimetic element, for what those products say about you. The classic example of this is boycotting that have become more popular recently. The classic example was the Bud Light boycott when individuals on the right stopped drinking Bud Light because Bud Light put out an ad with Dylan Mulvaney, who is a transgender person. And it became a show of, well, I don't want to be associated with that.

Because Bud Light is gay, and I don't want to be gay. I'm using gay here to mean like liberal, almost. It really is a term that stands in certain circles for just the other. Now I'm sure that there are people on the right who really like Bud Light, who like the taste of it, who have drunk it their whole lives. But this one incident said, you know what, I'm going to drink something else now. And maybe they just switched to Budweiser. 

Take another example, another drink-based example. When the CEO of Coca-Cola presented Donald Trump at the White House with an inaugural Diet Coke can or bottle, because Trump allegedly drinks 12 Diet Cokes a day and has a button where he presses it and he gets a Diet Coke. So he was presented with this, and people on the left were obviously not happy about this, and there were calls on social media to boycott Coke, people saying, "This is the last Coke I'll drink. Switching to Pepsi. Whatever." 

Now again here, I'm sure some of those people really liked Coke. They really thought it tasted good. So why would they do this? So again, this is why I find Landy's critique lacking. It's because in both these instances, as in many other instances that happen in society, the need, the appetite for Coke, the appetite for Bud Light is there. People like it. The product is good. It tastes good, but it's just totally dwarfed in importance compared to whatever else is going on, and that whatever else is Girard's theory.

Now I'm going to introduce an idea. It's a little different here, which explains both, but we'll focus on the Trump example just because I think it's interesting, which is balance theory. So you can imagine that this subject-model-object framework creates a triangle. The subject wants to be like the model. The model desires the object, so then the subject desires the object. Now there's this thing called balance theory that there are four possible combinations of triangles with positive and negative edges. And this is my own addition. This isn't something Girard really looked into. This is something we'll cover more in a future post, but you can have plus plus plus, plus plus minus, plus minus minus, or minus minus minus. Those are your four options. Balance theory says that only two of those are stable: plus plus plus and plus minus minus. Plus plus plus makes sense. Plus minus minus is when it's us against them, so it may not be the best thing in the world, but it is stable. You know who is on your team and you know who you're against. Plus plus minus is confusing—that's when you're friends with two people who hate each other. And then minus minus minus is when everybody hates everybody, and it's just confusing. And if you really hated somebody else, you would just team up against them. This is super brief, but I'm just putting it in here just for context. 

(illustration above)

Now, in our Trump example, we have the subject, which is, you know, your average Joe. Let's say it's one of these liberals in this case. And then the model in this case is Trump. Now, you may say, oh, Trump's not a model to liberals. Well, he serves as an anti-model. Whatever Trump does, they do the opposite. They hate Trump, so that has a negative edge. And then you may say, oh, Trump's not a model to the rules. Well, he serves as an anti-model. Whatever Trump does, they do the opposite. They hate Trump. So that has a negative edge. Then Trump likes Coke. That's a positive edge. And then the question is, what do you do? Do you like Coke or do you hate Coke? Let's say this person liked Coke to begin with. Now we have a triangle with two positive edges and one negative. So you as a subject have trouble liking Coke because Trump likes Coke, and you hate Trump, right? You don't like anything Trump does. And if that's so important to you, you would therefore stop liking Coke. That's it. Then it becomes you both hate Coke and Trump. Coke and Trump are on a team together, and then you hate both of them. Trump and Coke are Republican, you're a Democrat. Maybe Pepsi's on your team, so you become better friends with Pepsi. Maybe you start drinking more Pepsi, right? That's it. The other option is for Coke to stop liking Trump. So that's where Coke, which even though that's the object in this framework, can still act. So Coke distances itself from Trump. Maybe it just goes neutral. Maybe it explicitly says, "We don't actually like Trump's policies that much," and then it walks back on the whole White House thing that it did. That's what Bud Light did after this whole shenanigans with the Dylan Mulvaney scandal. They walked back their rhetoric and then did an advertisement with Shane Gillis and Post Malone. The opposite or maybe sort of neutral. You might call it right-center. So those are the options. 

(would love some illustrations throughout here to make this more clear)

So why is this important? What is this emblematic of? Why should we pay attention to these sort of silly cultural phenomena? Well, it's because the same mechanism that we describe where you can overcome your sort of animal taste of liking Coke or hating a Brussels sprout based on your mimetic desire to be healthy or MAGA or antitrust also means that you can overcome—means that if it escalates, it's that same mechanism which will make it so you can overcome your animal need to survive, of self-preservation, in order for you to be a good right or left, a good member of your political tribe.

That's the danger. It's the same mechanism. It's a difference of degree. Now that might sound like a bit of a leap to you, and how exactly we get there and how that works, how this sort of mechanism escalates to violence is a story for another day. We have more theory to work through, and we have more dynamics to understand before we can get to the point where we genuinely understand how simply boycotting Bud Light or Pepsi or Coke can lead to genuine political violence, how that works, how it has worked in past societies, and how it will work in ours. 

But friends, newcomers, if you've made it this far, thank you for reading my first post of a publication I'm calling Political Atheism, a title which, to those who know Girard's theory, is hopefully clear. To those who do not, I will explain at some point. I hope you found this useful. I thank you for taking the time to read. I'm hoping to find the time to do posts like these frequently enough, so if you aren't already, throw your email in. I think that given this crazy state of the world, these are important ideas to be exploring. And I welcome any feedback, any thoughts, any comments. If you know me, feel free to reach out personally. I'd love to pick up the phone and talk through this stuff if you find this of interest.
