# Editorial Notes for Post 1: Coke vs Sparkling Water

## Overall Approach
- Preserved the conversational, dictated tone as requested
- Fixed grammatical errors and cleaned up rambling sentences
- Integrated sources naturally without academic block quotes
- Added section headers for better flow and readability
- Integrated screenshots and generated triangle illustrations

## Changes Made

### Structure & Flow
- Added section headers to break up the text and guide readers
- Moved from Brussels sprouts → Girard's position → sparkling water → boycotts → balance theory → conclusion
- This follows your original flow but makes it clearer with visual breaks

### Language Cleanup
- Fixed: "Now the thing is René Girard" → "Now the thing is, René Girard" (added comma)
- Fixed: "no matter how much you try" → kept as "no matter how much coaxing you do" (original was fine)
- Cleaned up run-on sentences, especially in the "amalgamation of things" paragraph
- Made "gay" usage clearer with context about how it's used as shorthand for "the other"

### Quotes & Sources Integrated
- Added Landy's Brussels sprout quote directly from the PDF
- Added Landy's Coke/Pepsi quote with the Cruz/Crawford image
- Linked to the children-bitter-article for the bitter foods adaptation claim
- Referenced Trump's 12 Diet Cokes a day (well-documented)
- Integrated all the social media screenshots showing the boycott examples

### Images Included
1. Trump and CEO with inaugural Diet Coke bottle (opening image)
2. Landy's page showing Penélope Cruz (Coke) vs Cindy Crawford (Pepsi) models
3. Multiple social media screenshots showing boycott calls
4. Balance theory triangles diagram (generated)
5. Trump-Coke resolution options diagram (generated)

## Minor Issues / Questions

### Potential Clarifications Needed
1. **Line about "2018 interview"** in original - The Girard interview source file shows it's from 2018, but the actual quote about desert/water isn't in that snippet. I referenced the concept generally rather than quoting directly. You may want to find the exact quote if you want to include it verbatim.

2. **Balance theory source** - You mention this is your own addition to Girard, which I kept. Balance theory (Heider) is a real psychological theory, and the seed conversation shows it's well-established. Just noting that readers unfamiliar with it might want a source, though for a blog post this casual tone works fine.

3. **Brussels sprouts breeding** - The original mentions that modern Brussels sprouts are less bitter due to breeding. This is true but wasn't in your zero draft. I kept it simple and just focused on kids being bitter-averse as an adaptation.

4. **Shane Gillis/Post Malone** - You mention Bud Light doing an ad with them after the Mulvaney controversy. This is accurate (the Shane Gillis partnership happened), but just flagging in case you want to add a reference or screenshot.

## Tone Check
The post maintains your voice throughout - casual, smart, slightly irreverent. The "gay means liberal/the other" explanation is handled carefully. The ending stays personal and inviting as you wrote it.

## Possible Additions (Optional)
- Could add a brief definition of "mimetic desire" for complete newcomers in the opening
- Could add a sentence about what "Political Atheism" means, though you said you'd explain later
- Could add more transition between the balance theory section and the "why this matters" section

## What's Working Really Well
- The sparkling water example is brilliant and very relatable
- The Brussels sprouts at restaurants bit is funny and illustrative
- The boycott examples with screenshots make it very concrete and current
- The balance theory triangles give readers a visual framework to understand the dynamics
- The finance bros longing for shotguns example shows the nuance well

Overall, this is a strong first post that's accessible, timely, and sets up future posts well.
